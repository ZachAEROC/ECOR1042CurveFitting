This is a curve fitting exercise for ECOR1042 AB F24

The data contained is the voltage gain of a low pass RC filter measured at different frqeuencies. Using python, create a user interface that:
- Runs continuously while the user wants to keep using it
- Asks the user what what range of data points they would like to curve fit, ie: points 1 to 80, or points 30 to 50
- Asks the user what order of polynomial they would like to curve fit
- Graphs the data points from along with the fitted curve, and displays the equation of the fitted curve in the terminal
